# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Overview:
This model is build on 2 logics:


| S.No| Playing Difficulty|
|--|--|
| 1| Easy|
| 2| Expert|

Easy model uses the Random function that gives the probability of *50%* to both party

Expert model is buit on Markov Chain that increases the probability of losing by *80%*
"you better be careful:)"

## Testing:
To test the discrete markov chain model :

```
python3 MarkovChainRPS.py

 > Press 5 to exit and fetch the matrix analytics for the test runs
```
