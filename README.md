# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Overview:
This model is build on 2 logics:
1 : Easy
2: Expert

Easy model uses the Random function that gives the probability of 50% to both party

Expert model is buit on Markov Chain that increases the probability of losing by 80%
"you better be careful:)"

## Testing:
To test the discrete markov chain model :
`python3 MarkovChainRPS.py`
press 5 to exit and fetch the matrix analytics for the test runs
